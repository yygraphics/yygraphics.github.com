description: 청년창업꿈터는 서울시가 청년 창업가들을 지원하기 위해 신촌의 낡은 모텔을 리모델링하여 만든 업무·주거 공간이다. 시민 공모로 선정된 이름의 의미를 담기위한 BI 프로젝트의 일환으로 로고를 디자인했다.<p><br/></p>"Seoul Changup KKumteo" is a workplace and housing space created by the Seoul Metropolitan Government by remodeling an old motel in Shinchon to support young entrepreneurs. We designed the logo as part of the BI project to represent the meaning of the name that was chosen for the citizenship contest.
